**Difficulty Level:** ðŸŸ¢ Beginner  
**Domain:** Tools and Technology

**Description:**  
This task involves writing a VBA script that creates a PowerPoint presentation using hardcoded data within the script itself. The VBA code will loop through an array or list of slide titles and content, creating a new slide for each entry. The script will dynamically populate each slide with a title and text content.

**Input Example:**

**Hardcoded Data in VBA Code:**

- Slide 1: Title - "Introduction", Content - "Welcome to the presentation"
- Slide 2: Title - "Agenda", Content - "Overview of project milestones"
- Slide 3: Title - "Conclusion", Content - "Summary of key takeaways"

**Output Example:**

A PowerPoint presentation containing 3 slides:

1. Slide 1: Title - "Introduction", Content - "Welcome to the presentation"
2. Slide 2: Title - "Agenda", Content - "Overview of project milestones"
3. Slide 3: Title - "Conclusion", Content - "Summary of key takeaways"
