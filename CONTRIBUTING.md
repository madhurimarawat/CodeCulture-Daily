## 🛠 How to Contribute

### 1. Submit a Solution

If you’re solving a challenge, follow these steps:

1. **Fork this repository**.
2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CodeCulture-Daily.git
   ```
3. **Create a branch** for your solution:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b solution-username(github-username)
   ```

4. Add Your Solution

To submit your solution for the challenge of the day (named after the date):

- **Create a file** in the corresponding folder for that day:
  - File name: `solution_username.ext` (for tech questions)
  - For non-tech questions, please submit your answer in **Markdown format**.
  - Optional: Add `Explanation.md` if you’d like to explain your approach.

5. **Push your branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin solution-username
   ```
6. **Open a pull request**.

### 2. Add a New Challenge

If you want to contribute a new challenge:

1. **Create a folder** with the date of the challenge as the folder name (e.g., `07-10-2024`).
2. Inside the folder, **add a `Question.md`** file with the challenge description.
3. **Submit a pull request**, and once merged, the challenge will be scheduled for the next available day.
4. You can submit your solution the next day once it's merged, or if you don’t have a solution, don’t worry—we'll try to solve it together!
