### **Question: Complex Number Operations**

**Difficulty Level:** ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate  
**Domain:** Programming (C Language)

**Description:**  
This task involves implementing operations on complex numbers using C. Complex numbers have real and imaginary parts, and common operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user will input two complex numbers, and the program will perform the selected operation (based on user choice). The program should also include proper input validation and error handling.

**Input Example:**

```c
Enter the real and imaginary parts of the First Complex number: 3 2
Enter the real and imaginary parts of the Second Complex number: 1 7
```

**Output Example:**

```
****Complex Number Addition****
Result is: 4 + 9i

Why did the complex number break up? It couldn't find a real solution!
```

**Instructions:**

1. Implement functions for:
   - Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division of complex numbers.
   - A menu-driven system where the user can choose the operation to perform.
2. The program should:
   - Allow continuous input of complex numbers and repeat operations until the user exits.
   - Perform proper input validation for the operation choice.
3. Include comments and humor to make the output fun and engaging.
