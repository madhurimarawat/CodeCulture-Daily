### **Question: Descendo-Pyramid Pattern Printing**

**Difficulty Level:** ðŸŸ¢ Beginner  
**Domain:** Patterns and Loops

### **Objective:**

Create a program that prints a pyramid-like pattern based on a given integer input `n`, showcasing a symmetric descent and ascent in values.

### **Problem Description:**

Given an integer input `n`, your task is to print a pattern where:

- The first row starts with `0`.
- Each subsequent row symmetrically adds decreasing numbers on both sides of the center, continuing until reaching the input number.

### **Input:**

- A single integer `n` (1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 20), representing the number of rows to print.

### **Output:**

- A pattern printed in the described format, with rows displaying a descending and then ascending sequence of numbers symmetrically.

### **Example:**

#### Input:

```plaintext
Enter Number of Rows: 4
```

#### Output:

```plaintext
0
1 0 1
2 1 0 1 2
3 2 1 0 1 2 3
```

### **Constraints:**

- The input `n` must be a positive integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive).

### **Note:**

Ensure that the pattern is printed in a visually appealing manner, with the numbers aligned symmetrically for easy readability.
