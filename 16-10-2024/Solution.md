### Suggested Solution

1. **Listening and Understanding Perspectives**  
   Set up a team meeting where everyone, especially the backend developer, can express their reasons for preferring Vue.js. Be sure to listen without interrupting, showing empathy for their experience and concerns. You should also explain why you prefer React, highlighting its benefits such as ease of use, scalability, and the community support behind it.

2. **Conflict Resolution and Communication**  
   After both perspectives are laid out, focus on finding common ground. For example, you could mention that both frameworks are great choices, and the decision should come down to which one fits the project needs better, rather than personal preferences. Keep the conversation professional and focused on the project's goals rather than individual opinions.

3. **Finding Common Ground**  
   Suggest conducting a brief technical evaluation of both frameworks. For example, the team could spend a day creating a small feature or component using both React and Vue.js to see which integrates more smoothly with the backend and better meets the projectâ€™s requirements. Alternatively, propose using **React** for the frontend and **Vue.js** for certain dynamic parts of the app where Vue.js excels.

4. **Maintaining Team Productivity**  
   Once a decision is made (let's say React is chosen), encourage the backend developer to help with parts of the system they are comfortable with, such as API integration, while you handle the frontend work. Ensure that the decision is final, and everyone is committed to moving forward productively.

By focusing on a **solution-oriented approach**, you demonstrate strong conflict resolution and communication skills, ensuring that the project can progress smoothly.
