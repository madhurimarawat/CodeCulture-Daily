### Example Situation: Handling Conflict in a Team

You are part of a team tasked with developing a web application for a client. The team consists of a frontend developer, backend developer, designer, and a project manager. You, as the frontend developer, prefer using **React** for the frontend framework because of its component-based architecture and scalability. However, the backend developer strongly insists on using **Vue.js**, as they have more experience with it and believe it will integrate better with the backend systems they are managing.

This disagreement creates tension within the team, delaying the projectâ€™s progress. The project manager wants the team to resolve the conflict quickly, as deadlines are approaching, and the client is expecting a progress update soon.
