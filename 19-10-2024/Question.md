### **Question.md: Data Visualization Using Python and Pandas**

**Difficulty Level:** ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate  
**Domain:** Data Visualization

**Description:**  
This task requires you to perform data visualization using Python's Pandas library on the given NBA dataset (`nba.csv`). You are required to generate insightful plots that reveal important trends or patterns in the dataset. These plots should be created using libraries such as `matplotlib` or `seaborn`, and the data should be properly cleaned and prepared before visualization.

The visualization must focus on key metrics such as player statistics (age, height, weight, salary, etc.) and team performance. You are expected to provide an analysis of the plots, highlighting the important insights that can be drawn from the data.

**Instructions:**

1. **Dataset:** The provided dataset (`nba.csv`) contains information about NBA players. You will load and analyze this data, and create meaningful visualizations to uncover trends and insights.
2. **Visualization Requirements:**

   - Plot the distribution of player ages, heights, and salaries.
   - Create a scatter plot of player salary vs. performance metrics (e.g., points per game).
   - Visualize team-based statistics and trends (e.g., average salary by team, player distribution across teams).
   - Analyze any correlation between variables such as player height and weight, salary and experience, etc.

3. **Output:**

   - Submit your code in a `.py` file or a Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`).
   - Include at least three visualizations in your submission.
   - Provide clear labels, titles, and legends for each plot to enhance readability.

4. **Additional Documentation:**
   - You can optionally submit an **Explanation.md** file where you describe the insights derived from the visualizations.

**Input Example:**

**NBA Dataset:**  
Some key columns include:

- Player Name
- Team
- Position
- Age
- Height
- Weight
- Salary

**Output Example:**

You should submit visualizations such as:

- A bar plot of player age vs. weight.
- A scatter plot of player age vs. weight.
