### Explanation

**Why do arrays have trust issues?**
Because every time they look for something greater, itâ€™s always out of bounds! ðŸ˜‚

This code finds the "Next Greater Number" for each element in a circular array, where each elementâ€™s next greater number is the first element that appears after it in a circular traversal of the array. If no such greater number is found, the code outputs `-1` for that element.

1. **Input Initialization**:

   - The user is prompted to input the number of elements, `N`, and then each element in the circular array, which is stored in a list, `circular_array`.

2. **Function to Find Next Greater Element**:

   - The `next_greater_element()` function takes `circular_array` as input and returns a list of next greater numbers.
   - **Outer Loop**: The outer loop iterates over each element in the array.
   - **Inner Loop**: For each element, it checks all subsequent elements in the array in a circular manner to find the first greater element.
     - **Circular Calculation**: Modulo arithmetic `(i + j) % N` is used to wrap around to the start of the array when needed.
     - **Break Condition**: If a greater element is found, it assigns this value to `next_greater` and breaks out of the inner loop.

3. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the result for each element, showing its next greater number or `-1` if none exists.
