**Difficulty Level:** 🟢 Beginner  
**Domain:** Loops and Patterns

- Develop a program to print an engaging pattern called the "Diya Harmony Pattern."
- This pattern showcases rows of colored diyas (represented by emojis) in a symmetrical and visually pleasing arrangement.
- The user will specify the number of rows \( r \). The program should print a pattern of colored diyas based on the following rules:
  - Each row will display a sequence of colored diyas, cycling through the colors available.
  - If \( r \) is greater than the number of available colors (5), the program will repeat the same pattern for additional rows using the modulus operation. This ensures that the same sequence of colors continues even as the number of rows increases.

### **Input:**

- An integer \( r \) representing the number of rows (1 ≤ \( r \)).

### **Output:**

- A visually appealing arrangement of colored diyas based on the number of rows specified.

### **Examples:**

#### For \( r = 5 \):

#### Input:

```
Enter Number of Rows: 5
```

#### Output:

```

```

#### For \( r = 7 \):

#### Input:

```
Enter Number of Rows: 7
```

#### Output:

```
