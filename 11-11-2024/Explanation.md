## Explanation:

**Why was the `0` feeling lonely in the array?** ðŸ¤”

Because all the other numbers already found their perfect `1` to pair up with! ðŸ˜‚

The provided code finds the maximum length of a contiguous subarray within a binary array that contains an equal number of `0`s and `1`s.

### **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Input Reading**:

   - The code starts by accepting a space-separated string input from the user and converts it into a list of integers (`nums`).

2. **Initialization**:

   - `max_len` is initialized to `0` to store the maximum length of the subarray found.

3. **Iterating Through the Array**:

   - The code uses nested loops:
     - The outer loop iterates through each starting index `i`.
     - The inner loop iterates from the beginning up to the current index `i`, counting the number of `0`s and `1`s.

4. **Counting `0`s and `1`s**:

   - During each iteration of the inner loop:
     - The counts of `0`s and `1`s (`count_0` and `count_1`) are updated.
     - If `count_0` equals `count_1`, the code calculates the `current_length` of the subarray.

5. **Updating Maximum Length**:

   - If the `current_length` is greater than `max_len`, `max_len` is updated.

6. **Output**:
   - Finally, the code prints the `max_len`, which is the length of the longest subarray with equal numbers of `0`s and `1`s.
