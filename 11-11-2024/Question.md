## Question: **Equal Contiguous Array**

**Difficulty Level:** ðŸŸ¢ Beginner  
**Domain:** Arrays and Searching

### **Objective:**

Create a program to find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with an equal number of `0`s and `1`s in a given binary array.

### **Problem Description:**

Given a binary array consisting of only `0`s and `1`s, your task is to identify the longest contiguous subarray that contains an equal number of `0`s and `1`s and return its length.

### **Input:**

- A binary array `arr` where (1 â‰¤ length â‰¤ 10,000).

### **Output:**

- An integer representing the length of the longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of `0`s and `1`s.

### **Example:**

#### Input:

```plaintext
arr = [0, 1, 0]
```

#### Output:

```plaintext
2
```

#### Explanation:

- The subarray `[0, 1]` has an equal number of `0`s and `1`s, and its length is `2`.
