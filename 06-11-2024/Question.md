### **Base 7 String Representation**

**Difficulty Level:** ðŸŸ¢ Beginner  
**Domain:** Number Systems and Base Conversions

### **Objective:**

Given an integer, return its base 7 **string representation**.

### **Problem Description:**

We need to convert a given integer into its base 7 representation. This can be achieved by repeatedly dividing the integer by 7 and recording the remainders. These remainders, when read in reverse order, will provide the base 7 representation.

### **Input:**

- A single integer `n` (0 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10^6).

### **Output:**

- A string representing the number in base 7.

### **Example:**

#### Input:

```plaintext
100
```

#### Output:

```plaintext
202
```

### **Note:**

- If the input number is 0, the output should be "0".
- This problem can be solved using simple arithmetic operations and loops.
