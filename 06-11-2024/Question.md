For the second problem, where we need to convert a number into its base 7 string representation, we can follow these steps:

1. Dividing the number by 7 repeatedly and keeping track of the remainders will give us the digits in base 7, starting from the least significant digit.
2. The remainders collected in reverse will form the base 7 representation.
