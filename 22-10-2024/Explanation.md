### Managing Time and Priorities

When faced with multiple competing priorities, it’s crucial to balance both your workload and your team’s needs. Here’s how I would approach the situation:

1. **Assess the Situation:**
   - First, I would quickly evaluate the urgency and complexity of both tasks. If my teammate's issue is a critical bug that could block further progress, I would acknowledge its importance but also consider the deadline of my own task, the login system.
2. **Communicate Transparently:**
   - I would communicate with my teammate to understand the details of their request, how much time it might take, and the consequences of delaying my own task. Transparency is key. I would also reach out to the project manager to inform them of the situation, ensuring they are aware of any potential delays or resource shifts.
3. **Prioritize and Delegate (if possible):**

   - Depending on the time required, I could assist with the bug fix for a short period, helping resolve it quickly. If the bug is complex and requires significant time, I would propose a solution: either allocate time after completing my own task or see if another team member with more immediate availability can assist.

4. **Stay Flexible, but Maintain Focus:**

   - If the bug is truly blocking progress, I would prioritize it over my task but ensure that once it’s resolved, I return to my original priority without losing focus. Time management tools (e.g., breaking down both tasks into smaller steps) could help me stay on track.

5. **Provide a Clear Plan:**
   - After helping with the bug, I would adjust my own timeline accordingly and provide a realistic estimate to the project manager regarding the completion of the login system, ensuring they are updated on any potential impact on the schedule.

By managing priorities effectively, communicating openly, and offering solutions, I can ensure that the project continues to move forward while maintaining team harmony.
