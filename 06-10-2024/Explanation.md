### Explanation of the Solution Logic:

1. **Input and Initialization**:  
   The input to the function is a list of scores representing athletes. We start by checking if the list is empty to avoid any errors and then proceed with the logic.

2. **Sorting Indices**:  
   Instead of sorting the scores themselves, we create a list of indices sorted by the score values in descending order. This helps us track the original positions of the athletes while comparing their scores.

3. **Medal Assignment**:  
   Using the sorted indices, we assign medals to the top three athletes:
   - The athlete at the first index of the sorted list receives the "Gold Medal."
   - The athlete at the second index receives the "Silver Medal."
   - The athlete at the third index receives the "Bronze Medal."
4. **Rank Assignment**:  
   For all other athletes, we assign their ranks as strings, starting from rank 4 and going onward.

5. **Output**:  
   The function returns the updated list where the top three athletes are awarded medals, and the rest are assigned their relative ranks.

### Example Input:

```python
[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

### Example Output:

```python
["Gold Medal", "Silver Medal", "Bronze Medal", "4", "5"]
```
