### **Example Dialogue Script:**

üòÑ **Why did the team argue about work distribution?**  
Because they couldn't "divide and conquer"! ü§ù‚ú®

**You:** "Hey Alex, Jordan, thanks for sitting down with me. I understand there‚Äôs been some tension about how tasks are being divided. I want to make sure we find a solution that works for both of you, so let‚Äôs talk this through. Alex, would you like to start by sharing your concerns?"

**Alex:** "Yeah, thanks. I just feel like I‚Äôve been taking on most of the work lately, especially with the data analysis part of the project. Jordan has been focusing more on the creative side, and I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs a balanced split. I‚Äôve brought it up a couple of times, but nothing‚Äôs changed, and it‚Äôs starting to feel overwhelming."

**You:** "I hear you, Alex. It sounds like you‚Äôre feeling a bit overloaded, and that‚Äôs important to address. Jordan, how do you see the situation? Do you feel the task division is fair?"

**Jordan:** "Well, I honestly think the division is fair. I‚Äôve been putting in a lot of effort on the creative side, and I thought the distribution of tasks made sense. We both have our strengths, and I assumed Alex was okay with it since there wasn‚Äôt much pushback at the beginning."

**You:** "Okay, it sounds like there‚Äôs a bit of a misunderstanding between both of you. Alex, I can see how the data analysis could be a heavy load, especially if you're not getting the support you need. Jordan, it seems like you thought the workload was balanced based on the initial setup, but perhaps there was an assumption that wasn‚Äôt fully communicated. How do you both feel about adjusting the task split, maybe by shifting some of the more time-consuming tasks from Alex to another part of the project?"

**Alex:** "That could work, but I‚Äôm still worried that I‚Äôll end up doing most of the work in the end."

**Jordan:** "I get that, and I don‚Äôt want you to feel like you're carrying all the weight. I‚Äôm open to helping more with the analysis, but I think I can‚Äôt do too much because the creative side requires attention too."

**You:** "Great, so here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking: What if we try a more defined division of tasks moving forward, where each of you takes responsibility for a specific part of the project, but with regular check-ins to ensure the workload feels fair? For example, Jordan, you could take on part of the data analysis, and Alex, you could assist with refining the creative side when needed. How does that sound?"

**Alex:** "That sounds better. Regular check-ins might help keep things in balance and avoid any misunderstandings."

**Jordan:** "I‚Äôm okay with that too. I don‚Äôt mind helping more with the analysis, especially if we check in regularly to make sure we‚Äôre both on the same page."

**You:** "Fantastic! I think this is a good compromise. Let's plan to meet at least once a week to review the progress and adjust as needed. The goal is for both of you to feel like the workload is manageable and that you‚Äôre both contributing equally. Does that work for both of you?"

**Alex & Jordan:** "Yes, that works!"

### **Explanation:**

This scenario targets **conflict resolution** and **teamwork skills**, which are essential in a collaborative workplace. The key elements in this script include:

1. **Active Listening:** Both Alex and Jordan are given the opportunity to voice their concerns. As a mediator, you demonstrate empathy by acknowledging each person‚Äôs feelings and validating their experiences.

2. **Clarifying Misunderstandings:** By encouraging both individuals to share their perspectives, you uncover that the conflict stemmed from assumptions and lack of communication rather than intentional unfairness.

3. **Facilitating Compromise:** You help both team members reach a balanced solution‚Äîadjusting the task division and adding regular check-ins to ensure fairness moving forward.

4. **Fostering Collaboration:** The solution not only addresses the workload issue but also promotes continued collaboration, which is critical to maintaining a positive team dynamic.

This question challenges candidates to demonstrate their ability to manage conflict while maintaining respect and understanding for different perspectives‚Äîa key skill in most work environments.
