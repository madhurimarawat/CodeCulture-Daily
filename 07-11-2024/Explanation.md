#### Program Explanation

ðŸ¤– Joke: Why did the alphabet pattern go to therapy?
**ðŸ‘‰ Answer: It had too many issues with reflection! ðŸ˜…**

The code generates a pattern of alphabet characters in a mirrored form. Here is a detailed explanation of how it works:

1. **Input Prompt**:

   - The program first prompts the user to enter the number of rows (`r`) for the pattern.

2. **Outer Loop**:

   - The outer `for` loop iterates from `r` down to 1. This determines the total number of rows to be printed.

3. **Midpoint Calculation**:

   - The `mid` variable is calculated to determine where the pattern should start mirroring itself. This is calculated as `2 * i // 2`, where `i` is the current row number.

4. **Inner Loop**:

   - The inner `for` loop runs for `2 * i` times, printing characters based on the column index (`j`):
     - If `j` is less than `mid`, the program prints characters in ascending order starting from 'A'.
     - If `j` is greater than or equal to `mid`, the program prints mirrored characters in descending order to complete the row symmetrically.

5. **Output**:
   - The result is a symmetrical pattern of letters printed in rows, with each row showing mirrored alphabetical characters centered around the midpoint.

### Example Output

For an input of `r = 5`, the output would look like:

```
A B C D E E D C B A
A B C D     D C B A
A B C         C B A
A B             B A
A                 A
```
