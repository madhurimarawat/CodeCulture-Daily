### **Explanation:**

1. **Purpose of `auto` in C++:**

   - The `auto` keyword simplifies variable declarations by letting the compiler deduce the variable's type from the initializer. This feature is especially useful in cases where the type is complex or less readable, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

2. **Variable Initialization and Type Inference:**

   - In this program, we declare several variables using `auto` with different types of initializers (like integers, floating-point numbers, and strings). The compiler then determines each variable’s type based on the assigned value:
     - For instance, assigning an integer value allows the compiler to deduce the type as `int`.
     - A floating-point number will result in a `double` type.
     - A string literal is interpreted as a pointer to a constant character array (`const char*`).

3. **Type Display with `typeid`:**
   - After declaring the variables, the program uses `typeid(variable).name()` to obtain the inferred type’s internal representation. This is displayed as shorthand:
     - `i` represents an integer type.
     - `d` represents a double type.
     - `PKc` denotes a pointer to a constant character string, `const char*`.
   - This feature helps verify that `auto` has deduced the correct types for the initialized variables, demonstrating how `auto` enables simpler code without sacrificing type safety.
