### Explanation

**Why did the keyboard get kicked out of the typing club?**  
Because it kept _shifting_ between rows! ðŸ˜‚

In this code:

1. **Input Collection:** We first take the number of words and store each word in `word_list`.
2. **Function Definition:** `word_row_type` checks if each word can be typed on a single row by:
   - Converting the word to uppercase.
   - Using a list of keyboard rows to check if all letters of the word are contained within any one row.
3. **Filtering Typable Words:** Using list comprehension, we select words that meet the typing criteria.
4. **Output:** The resulting list of row-typable words is printed.

This solution uses list comprehension and built-in functions for an efficient and beginner-friendly approach to the problem.
