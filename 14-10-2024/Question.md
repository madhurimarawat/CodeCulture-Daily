### **Question: Prime Number Efficiency Optimization**

**Difficulty Level:** ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate  
**Domain:** Refactoring/Documentation

**Description:**  
This task involves refactoring and documenting a Python program that checks for prime numbers within a given limit. The current implementation includes an inefficient primality check, poor variable naming conventions, and lacks proper documentation. You are required to improve the code's performance, readability, and maintainability by optimizing the algorithm, improving variable names, and adding comments and docstrings. You will also time the execution of the optimized version and compare it with the original.

**Input Example:**

```python
get_primes(10000)
```

**Output Example:**

```
Total Prime Numbers Found: 1229
Time Taken: 0.154328 seconds
```

**Instructions:**

1. Refactor the code by:

   - Improving the prime-checking logic (e.g., only checking up to the square root of the number).
   - Using more descriptive variable names.
   - Optimizing loops and reducing redundant calculations.

2. Add proper documentation by:

   - Writing docstrings for all functions.
   - Commenting on the purpose of each code section and explaining the logic used.

3. Include execution timing with informative output that clearly explains the performance comparison between the original and optimized versions.

4. Output the number of primes found and the time taken to find them in a clean and user-friendly format.

**Considerations:**

- Efficient algorithms like the **Sieve of Eratosthenes** can be used to optimize prime-checking.
- Ensure the code is clear, readable, and well-documented for future maintainers.
- Use appropriate data structures and avoid hard-coding values, making the code more adaptable to different input sizes.
