### **Question: Exploring Alternatives in Internship Project**

**Difficulty Level:** ðŸŸ¢ Beginner  
**Domain:** Problem-Solving / Adaptability and Communication

**Description:**  
You are working on an anomaly detection project during your internship at a steel mill, where the goal is to predict potential equipment failures based on sensor data. After implementing models like LSTM and others, the results are not as accurate or reliable as expected, despite your best efforts. In a review meeting, your supervisor suggests finding alternative approaches to improve the detection accuracy. Now, you need to come up with a plan that not only involves refining the model but also consulting domain experts (people working directly with the mill equipment) and conducting further online research to better understand the problem.

How do you handle this feedback constructively, present your plan for improving the project, and seek out additional resources to find a solution?

Your response should:

1. Demonstrate your openness to exploring alternative methods and seeking feedback.
2. Highlight your ability to communicate effectively with mentors and other stakeholders.
3. Show how you would incorporate expert opinions and research to arrive at a more accurate solution.
