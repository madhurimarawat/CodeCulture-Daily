### **Solution: Exploring Alternatives in Internship Project**

üõ†Ô∏è **Why did the anomaly detector go to therapy?**  
ü§ñ **Because it had too many issues to handle on its own!** üòÖ

**Approach:**

1. **Consult Domain Experts:**

   - **Action:** Schedule meetings with mill engineers, technicians, and operators to understand operational nuances and critical failure points that might not be obvious from the data alone. Their hands-on experience can provide valuable insights that may lead to features or patterns you've missed in the current model.
   - **Justification:** Domain experts can offer contextual knowledge that will help refine your model by focusing on the most relevant parameters and failure indicators. They may also help identify common but hard-to-detect issues that are not visible in standard data analysis.

2. **Research Alternative Methods:**

   - **Action:** Dive into online research to explore newer anomaly detection techniques, such as using Autoencoders, Isolation Forest, or hybrid models (combining statistical methods and machine learning). Look for recent studies in industrial data science and anomaly detection to find applicable methodologies.
   - **Justification:** The online research will help broaden the scope of your approach and introduce alternative techniques that might work better with your dataset than traditional LSTM or basic models.

3. **Iterative Testing and Feedback:**

   - **Action:** After integrating new insights from domain experts and researching alternative models, perform iterative testing with various combinations of techniques. Share intermediate results with your mentor to get ongoing feedback and ensure the project is on the right track.
   - **Justification:** Keeping your mentor updated will ensure that you're aligned with the project goals and any changes or challenges are discussed early on, preventing any last-minute roadblocks.

4. **Maintain a Collaborative Approach:**
   - **Action:** Suggest a collaborative review session with both your mentor and domain experts to discuss any findings, model changes, and how to further improve the model.
   - **Justification:** This creates an environment for feedback and continuous improvement, helping to bridge the gap between technical modeling and operational knowledge from the field.

**Maintaining a Positive Attitude:**

- Emphasize that the feedback is an opportunity to learn and improve the project.
- Show eagerness to explore new techniques and collaborate with experienced professionals.
