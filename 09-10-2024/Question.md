### **Question: Caesar Cipher**

**Difficulty Level:** ðŸŸ¢ Beginner  
**Domain:** Programming Languages (Any Language)

**Description:**  
The Caesar cipher is a basic encryption technique where each letter in a given text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. This task involves implementing a Caesar Cipher that can encrypt and decrypt messages based on a given shift value. The cipher must be able to handle both uppercase and lowercase letters and wrap around the alphabet if necessary.

**Input Example:**

```python
message = "Hello"
shift_value = 3
```

**Output Example:**

```python
Encrypted Text: "Khoor"
Decrypted Text: "Hello"
```

**Instructions:**

1. Implement a function to create a Caesar cipher that shifts letters by a user-defined value.
2. The function should:
   - Encrypt the message by shifting letters based on the input.
   - Decrypt the message by reversing the shift.
3. Ensure that the cipher works for both uppercase and lowercase letters.
4. The solution can be implemented in any programming language (Python, C++, Java, etc.).
